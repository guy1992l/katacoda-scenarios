[MLRun](https://www.mlrun.org) is an end-to-end [open-source](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun)
MLOps orchestration framework to manage and automate your entire analytics and machine learning lifecycle, from data ingestion, through
model development, to full pipeline deployment in production and model monitoring. Its primary goal is to ease the development of machine
learning pipeline at scale and enable faster deployment of fully operational ML products.

MLRun offers  a convenient abstraction layer to a wide variety of technology stacks while empowering data engineers
and data scientists to define the features and models with ease and flexibility. MLRun includes an online and offline 
feature store that handles the ingestion, processing, transformation, metadata, and storage of data and features.
MLRun runs as a managed service in the [Iguazio MLOps Platform](https://www.iguazio.com/). 

In the following course you will learn how to:
- Setup a local developer environment with MLRun
- Create and run various ML functions using the CLI, SDK, and UI
- Build workflows, Track artifacts and results
- Connect to remote clusters and rapidly deploy code and pipelines to production at scale

More information about MLRun and its architecture can be found [here](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest).
