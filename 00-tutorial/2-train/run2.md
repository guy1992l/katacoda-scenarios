Function parameters are tracked and can be manipulated via the SDK/CLI.
Run the function again, and this time pass the `format=parquet` arg:

`mlrun run -f gen-iris -p format=parquet --local`{{execute}}

You can see that this time the dataset is created in `parquet` format

> `-p` is used to specify parameters, see `mlrun run --help` for more flags

Results can be accessed via the CLI, SDK, or UI. Click the next line:

`mlrun get run -p coda-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]`{{execute}}
